difference between fail safe and fail fast -
Fail safe iterator  does not throw concurrentmodificationexception while fail fast iterator throws.
Fail safe iterators e.g iterator provided by CopyOnWriteArrayList work on snapshot while fail safe iterator works on actual collection.
Elements in the fail safe iterators can not be modified while iterating while elements in the fail fast can be modified while iterating.
Examples of fail fast iterators are Vector, ArrayList, HashMap while that of the Fail Safe iteraor are ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet.
